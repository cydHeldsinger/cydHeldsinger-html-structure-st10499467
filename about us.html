        <p>
           

            Brief history of the organisation: the company was started in January 2025, by     
            
            Cyd Heldsinger, the company was created in order to provide organic skincare products, at an affordable price for people with lower income, specifically people ages 18 to 30. Since January 2025 the business has been struggling to find new client bases. The business is looking to create a website that helps bring traffic to the business. 
            
            The mission for the business is to bring affordable organic skincare to the masses. This mission is being executed due to the high price of organic skin care, and even higher number of people who cannot afford organic skincare 
            
            The vision for the company, is that it grows enough to supply the lower income households within South Africa with good quality skincare, that is less harmful due to chemicals as well as being more cost-effective than other skincare products.
